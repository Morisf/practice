Programming by interface, not implementation, is a core principle of good object-oriented design. It promotes decoupling, which makes your code more modular, reusable, and maintainable. Here are some tasks to practice this concept:

- **Simple Database Abstraction**: Create an interface named `DatabaseInterface` with methods like `connect()`, `query()`, `fetch()`, and `close()`.
Implement this interface for different databases (e.g., MySQL, SQLite). The goal is to switch databases without changing the code that uses this interface.


- **Logger System**: Define a `LoggerInterface` with methods like `log()`, `info()`, `error()`, etc.
Implement different loggers: FileLogger, DatabaseLogger, and ConsoleLogger.


- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Design a `PaymentGatewayInterface` with methods like `authorize()`, `charge()`, `refund()`.
Create implementations for different payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Braintree).


- **Shape Calculator**: Design a `NotifierInterface` with a method `send()`.
Implement different notification methods: EmailNotifier, SMSNotifier, PushNotifier.


- **File Storage**: Create an interface called `StorageInterface` with methods like `store()`, `retrieve()`, `delete()`.
Implement various storage systems: LocalFileStorage, S3Storage, DropboxStorage.


- **Caching**: Define a CacheInterface with methods `set()`, `get()`, and `delete()`.
Implement it for different caching systems: FileCache, Memcached, RedisCache.


- **API Clients**: Create an interface for making API requests: `APIClientInterface` with methods like `get()`, `post()`, etc.
Implement this for different services you might interact with, ensuring each adheres to the interface.

- **User Authentication**: Create an `AuthenticatorInterface` with methods `login()`, `logout()`, `isLoggedIn()`.
Implement different authentication mechanisms: SessionAuthenticator, TokenAuthenticator, OAuthAuthenticator.
Tips:

While working on these tasks, resist the temptation to reference specific implementations within another object. Use dependency injection to provide the concrete implementation of the interface to classes that depend on it.

Mocking for tests becomes easier when you program against interfaces. Consider writing tests and using mocking libraries to mock the interfaces.

Always keep the Interface Segregation Principle (one of the SOLID principles) in mind: Make fine-grained interfaces that are client-specific rather than one general-purpose interface.
